#     Enable vi mode. Use tab for word completion. This customizes behavior of libedit
#     editline(3) which is used in various interactive python sessions on osx. For word
#     completion, this configuration does not work for some python versions (e.g., 2.7.5)
#     due to a known bug. Use of a newer python version (e.g., 2.7.8) is recommended.
